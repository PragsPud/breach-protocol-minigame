## 📖 About

Breach Protocol is a hacking minigame featured in Cyberpunk 2077. Players must navigate a grid of hexadecimal codes, selecting them in sequence to match target patterns and upload "daemons" that provide rewards.

This recreation uses original code to simulate the puzzle mechanics without using any copyrighted assets from the game.

## 🎯 How to Play

### Objective
Complete one or more sequences by selecting hexadecimal codes from the Code Matrix and filling them into your Buffer.

### Rules
1. **Starting**: Click any code in the **top row** to begin. The timer starts with your first selection.
2. **Alternating Pattern**: 
   - First selection: Choose from any cell in the **top row**
   - Second selection: Choose from the **column** of your first selection
   - Third selection: Choose from the **row** of your second selection
   - Continue alternating between rows and columns
3. **Buffer Limit**: You have a limited buffer (7 slots) to complete sequences
4. **Time Limit**: Complete sequences before the 30-second timer runs out
5. **Sequences**: Match the target sequences shown on the right to upload daemons
6. **Completion**: Sequences can overlap - plan your path to complete multiple daemons efficiently

### Winning Conditions
- Complete at least one sequence before time runs out or buffer fills
- Ideal: Complete all three sequences for maximum reward
- You can exit early if you've completed sequences you want
